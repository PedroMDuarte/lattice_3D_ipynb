\section{ Compensated optical lattice} 

Our experiments take place in a compensated simple cubic optical lattice
potential, which is formed at the intersection of three orthogonal axes, see
Fig.~\ref{fig:compensated_lattice_simple_schematic}.  Along each axes, a 1D
lattice potential is formed by retro-reflecting a red detuned gaussian beam,
thus forming a sinusoidal intensity pattern along the beam.  Overlapped onto
each of the lattice beams we have a compensation beam, which is blue-detuned
and thus produces a repulsive potential.   The compensation beam is not
retro-reflected to avoid forming a standing wave potential.  
Fig.~\ref{fig:compensated_lattice_simple_schematic}.  
\begin{figure}
    \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/compensated_lattice_simple_schematic.png}
\caption{Simplified schematic of the compensated lattice
setup}\label{fig:compensated_lattice_simple_schematic}
\end{figure}

For the beam propagating along the $x$ axis, the expression for the lattice
potential is
\begin{equation}
 V_{L}( x; y,z) = - s_{0} \exp\left[- 2 \frac{ y^{2} + z^{2} }{w_{L}^{2}} \right]
  \cos^{2}( k_{L} x ) 
\end{equation}
where $s_{0}$ is the lattice depth at the center of the potential,  $w_{L}$ is
the lattice beam waist and $k_{L} = 2\pi/\lambda_{L}$ is the wavenumber of the
lattice light.
The expression for the compensation potential is 
\begin{equation}
 V_{C}( x; y, z) = g_{0}  \exp\left[ -2 \frac{ y^{2} + z^{2} }{w_{C}^{2}} \right] 
\end{equation}
where  $g_{0}$ is the depth (or rather height since it is repulsive) of the
compensating potential, and $w_{C}$ is the beam waist of the compensation beam. 

The combined potential of lattice plus compensation for the beam that
propagates along $x$ is 
\begin{equation}
  V_{1D}( x; y ,z ) = V_{L}(x; y,z) + V_{C}(x; y, z)
\end{equation}

The total potential for our simple cubic lattice is given by 
\begin{equation}
  V_{3D}(x, y, z)  =  V_{1D}( x; y,z) + V_{1D}( y; z,x) + V_{1D}(z; x,y)
\end{equation}


In what follows we will study the properties of a two spin-state mixture of
fermionic atoms in the compensated optical lattice potential.   We are
interested in the total entropy capacity of the potential, and also on the
possibility of evaporative cooling in the lattice potential.   

We use the high-temperature series expansion (HTSE),  an analytical solution to
the Hubbard model that is valid at high-temperatures\footnote{ The HTSE is very
good for $T \gg t$ and works down to $T/t \sim 1.8$ }.  This solution gives us
the thermodynamic quantities (density, double occupancy, entropy per particle,
etc.)  for a homogeneous system;  we then use the local density approximation
(LDA) to explore the properties of the sample in the compensated lattice
potential.  


\section{ Entropy redistribution }

In the quest for producing and antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered state with
cold atoms, the entropy per particle is an important metric.  It determines the
number of quantum states that are accessible to each atom.  At half-filling
there is an average of one-particle per site\footnote{Notice that half-filling
corresponds to $n=1$, for this reason sometimes the terms half-filling, unit
filling, and unit density are used interchangeably.  Here we will restrict the
terminology to half-filling or we will write explicitly $n=1$ to avoid
confusion.}.  If the temperature of the system is high, $T\gg U$,  there is an
equal probability for a site to be empty, singly or doubly occupied.  If  the
site is  singly occupied, the spin there could be up or down, so at high
temperatures there are a total of four ( $|0\rangle, |\spup\rangle,
|\spdn\rangle, |\dbl\rangle$ ) equally probable state at each lattice site,
giving an entropy per particle\footnote{Notice that at half-filling any
quantity per particle is the same as per lattice site, since $n=1$} is equal to
$s/\kb=\ln 4 = 1.38$.

When the temperature is $T<U$, double occupancies and vacancies are suppressed
and the system enters the Mott insulating state.  In this case the probability
of having empty sites or doubly occupied sites goes to zero.   At each site, a
particle can still  be spin-up or spin-down with equal probability, so the
entropy per particle becomes $s/\kb = \ln 2 = 0.69 $.   

As the temperature of the system goes below the N\'{e}el temperature, the spin
of the atoms becomes strongly determined by their position in the lattice,  as
they start to order antiferromagnetically.  At zero temperature each site has
only one possible quantum state (spin-up or spin-down depending on the lattice
site) and the entropy per particle goes to zero.

        \end{subfigure}%
        \caption{Calculations of entropy per lattice site versus temperature at half filling.}\label{fig:entropy-Fuchs-Paiva}
\end{figure}
For a homogeneous 3D lattice, at the N\'{e}el temperature $T_{N}=0.36t$, the
entropy per particle is $s=0.4\,\kb$.  As the temperature starts dropping below
$T_{N}$ the entropy approaches zero very quickly in what is referred to as the
AFM transition (AFM stands for antiferromagnetic order).  The AFM transition
has been studied theoretically for homogeneous 3D systems using  quantum
Monte Carlo (QMC)~\cite{Paiva2011} and the dynamical cluster approximation
(DCA)~\cite{Fuchs2011}.  The results from these two approaches are shown in
Figs.~\ref{fig:paiva-entropy3D},\ref{fig:fuchs-entropy3D}.

The theoretical calculations shown correspond to a homogeneous system, but in
practice  one has samples with a finite number of atoms so one is forced to
confine them in order to reach half-filling.   Since the confinement is
typically harmonic (as opposed to a well with hard walls), the density decays
as a function of distance to the center.   We will show below that this
inhomogeneity in the density leads to the concept of entropy redistribution.
We will see that the entropy necessary to achieve a N\'{e}el state can be
higher in a trapped system that in the homogeneous case. 


\subsection{High temperature series expansion for the Hubbard model}

In this section we will plot the thermodynamic properties of the Hubbard model
obtained using the high temperature series expansion (HTSE) to second
order~\cite{Henderson1992,Jordens2010}.   The  HTSE allows us to visualize the
signatures of the Mott insulating state:
\begin{itemize}
   \item The density as function of chemical potential has a plateau at $n=1$
   \item The double occupancy is suppressed 
   \item The density fluctuations are suppressed 
   \item The entropy per site as a function of filling has a dip at $n=1$. 
\end{itemize} 

For the homogeneous Hubbard model, we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:HTSEhomogeneous}
plots of the density,  double occupancy,  density fluctuations and entropy per
site.  We can see the signatures of the Mott state if we look at the variation
of the thermodynamic quantities at $n=1$.  As the temprature gets lower and the
interaction strength is increased these signatures become more pronounced.

\subsubsection{Entropy per particle}  

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/HTSE_EntropyPerSite_U.png}
    \caption{Entropy per lattice site versus density.}\label{fig:HTSE_spersite}
\end{figure}
The HTSE gives us the result for the entropy per lattice site, which we can
plot versus the density, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HTSE_spersite}  The
interesting result arises if we divide the entropy per lattice site by the
density, in order to obtain the entropy per particle.  This is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:HTSE_sperparticle}. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/HTSE_EntropyPerParticle_U.png}
    \caption{Entropy per particle versus density.}\label{fig:HTSE_sperparticle}
\end{figure}
It is seen there that the entropy per particle rises significantly for lower
filling values, and most importantly that the value of the entropy per particle
at low filling \textbf{does not} depend strongly on temperature or interaction
strength.   This property is refered to as the larger entropy capacity of the
metallic shell,  which is at the root of the idea of entropy redistribution. 

\subsection{Local density approximation}

In what follows we will use the results from HTSE and the local density
approximation to calculate trap profiles of the various thermodynamic
quantities.  A trapped gas with a finite number of atoms has a density that
inevitably decreases as a function of distance from the center.   As the
density goes down, the outer shells of the cloud, which are below half-filling,
will have a large entropy per particle.   The overall entropy per particle of
the trapped system, $S/N$, will be distributed such that most of it is carried by
the metallic edges of the cloud.

compensation}

atom number of 350,000.}
                \label{fig:HTSE_full-band-profiles_b}
        \end{subfigure}
	\caption{Full trap profiles of band structure and thermodynamic
quantities for a lattice without and with compensation.  For both cases the
atom number is chosen to be 350,000 atoms, and the filling at the center is
$n=1$.   Not that despite the very different band structure profiles, the
density profiles are very similar for both cases.  Even though the local
Hubbard parameters and the filling are set to be the same at the center of the
sample, the overall entropy per particle can be 1.5 times larger in the
compensated case (1.94\kb) than in the uncompensated case (1.34\kb). }
\label{fig:HTSE_full-band-profiles}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:HTSE_full-band-profiles} shows a comparison of the trap
profiles for a red detuned lattice without compensation
(\ref{fig:HTSE_full-band-profiles_a}) and a red detuned lattice with
compensation (\ref{fig:HTSE_full-band-profiles_b}).    In order to make a
legitimate comparison, we set the atom number to 350,000 atoms.  In the case
without compensation we vary the beam waist of the lattice beams such that a
density of $n=1$ is achieved at the center of the sample.   Lattice beams with
smaller beam waists will produce a stronger confinement, so in general if you
have a large amount of atoms and you want to achieve unit filling without
compensation you must use lattice beams with a large waist.    In the case with
compensation we use the lattice and compensation beam waists that we currently
have in our setup:  $w_{L}=47\,\mu$m and $w_{C}=40\,\mu$m.   We then adjust the
depth of the compensation beams to achieve half filling with 350,000 atoms.  


From looking at this figure we can see that even though the band structure
profiles are very different (in the compensated case the Hubbard parameters
vary strongly with radial distance),  the trap profiles of the density look
very similar in both cases.  Despite this similarity in the density,  the
double occupancy and the entropy per lattice site are slightly different.   The
important result is that even though in both cases one has the exact same local
state at the center (same filling, same $U/t$, same $s$)  the overall entropy
per particle can be larger for the compensated lattice by a factor of 1.5
(1.94\kb to 1.34\kb).   

This larger capacity of the compensated lattice to redistribute entropy is what
can make it favorable to achieve an AFM ordered state at the center of the
sample.   If one looks in more detail, as is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:HTSE_compare-thermo} one realizes that the larger entropy
capacity comes from a small enhancement of the double occupancy ( on the half-a
percent level ) which leads to a slightly larger entropy per particle on the
region from about 5\,$\mu$m to 25\,$\mu$m radius.   This radii encompass a
large volume of the trap, which can make a difference on the overall entropy
capacity even though the extra entropy per particle plotted radially looks very
small.  
\begin{figure}
    \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figures/HTSE_compare-thermo.png}
\caption{Detailed comparison of the thermodynamic quantities for the large beam
waist uncompensated lattice and the small beam waist compensated lattice.  The
density is very similar for both cases.  The double occupancy is quite
different, which leads to a very slightly larger entropy per particle across a
large range of radii in the trap. }\label{fig:HTSE_compare-thermo}
\end{figure}


The profiles that are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HTSE_full-band-profiles} are
calculated at a temperature $T=1.8t$, which is near the lowest temperature
value accesible with the HTSE.   The chemical potential, measured from the
lowest energy level available to the system (the bottom of the band) is set to
$\mu=6t +U/2$ to guarantee half-filling at the center.  \footnote{ The $6t$
here is half the bandwidth.  Note that in typical treatments the chemical
potential is always measured from the center of the lowest band, so the $6t$
will be omitted. In that case the chemical potential associated with
half-filling Will be $U/2$.  Some treatments even shift the zero of energy by
$U/2$ so that half filling occurs nominally at $\mu$=0 regardless of $U$. } We
used a value of $U=24.9t$,  given by the scattering length, which is set at
650$a_{0}$.   

Plugginng in these values we obtain $\mu\approx 18 t$  or $T/\mu \approx 1.8/18
= 0.1 $.  When the temperature is so low, one can safely assume that $\mu
\approx E_{F}$,  so this system would have  $T/T_{F}=0.06$ at an overall
entropy per particle of $S/N=1.94\kb$.  If the sample was obtained by ramping
up the lattice adiabatically starting from a harmonic trap, then the initial
entropy in the harmonic trap should also be 1.94\kb.  In the harmonic trap this
corresponds to $T/T_{F} = S/(\pi^{2} N) \approx 0.2$.  

We conclude from these rough estimates that as the sample gets loaded into the
lattice it gets adiabatically cooled, its value of $T/T_{F}$ is reduced.  This
is in contrast with the result obtained in~\cite{Kohl2006} where it was
concluded that loading a gas adiabatically from a harmonic trap to a deep
optical lattice would adiabatically heat the gas.   In this case we are
considering interactions and not neglecting the width of the lowest band.  Our
observation that the gas is adiabatically cooled as it is loaded into the
lattice are consistent with the results from~\cite{Paiva2011}.   

(NOTE: I NEED TO ASK THEREZA ABOUT THESE REMARKS TO CHECK THAT I AM NOT MAKING
A MISTAKE. 

The main question is whether it is ok to take $\mu=E_{F}$ since $\mu$ is in
the Mott gap.   Should one take  $E_{F}=12t$ in that case, since the top of the
band is the largest energy state that could potentially be occupied?? )


\subsubsection{ Enlarging the Mott state}  

In this section we consider our experimental setup
($w_{\text{L}}=47\,\mu\mathrm{m}$, $w_{\text{C}}=40\,\mu\mathrm{m}$)  and we
vary the amount of compensation.   What we find is that if no compensation is
used, then the number of atoms has to be very small in order to achieve
half-filling at the center.     On the other hand,  when using compensation one
can still hold a large number of atoms and maintain half-filling.   This leads
to the concept of enlarging the Mott state ( or N\'{e}el state if your
temperature is low enough)  which can be a very dramatic effect as was shown in
the paper by Mathy, Huse and Hulet~\cite{Mathy2012}.  

The effect of enlarging the Mott state is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:HTSE_enlarge-mott}, where we show the relationship between atom
number and compensation when the filling is set to $n=1$ at the center of the
cloud. This figure also shows the profile plots for no compensation and a
compensation of 3.05\,$E_{R}$,  in order to illustrate how the Mott plateau in
the density profile is enlarged for larger compensation.

\end{figure}


From what was discussed in \S\ref{sec:compare-big-small-waist}  we see that it
is also possible to reach an large Mott plateau for $N=350,000$ and wihtout
compensation beams:  you just need to have larger lattice beam waists.  As we
saw there, the advantage of realizing the large Mott plateau with small lattice
beam waists and compensating beams is  that this system has a larger entropy
capacity  than the large-beam-waist-uncompensated counterpart.   

In addition to this entropy capacity advantage, the
small-beam-waist-compensated setup offers the possibility of evaporative
cooling since the chemical potential comes much closer to the energy threshold
for an atom escaping along one of the lattice beams.  We will address this
point in the following section.  


\section{ Evaporative cooling in a lattice }

If we refer back to Fig.~\ref{fig:HTSE_full-band-profiles}  we can see that on
the energy landscape plot we used an orange line to indicate the evaporation
threshold, that is the energy necessary for an atom to escape along one of the
lattice beams.  Comparing the two cases one sees that the small beam waist
compensated case has a global chemical potential (green line) that is much
closer to the evaporation threshold.

When evaporative cooling a thermal gas of atoms, one considers the parameter
$\eta=U_{\text{trap}}/\kb T$, where $U_{\text{trap}}$ is the energy threshold
for a particle leaving the trap (i.e. the trap depth) and $T$ is the
temperature of the gas.   The evaporation rate is suppressed by a factor
$\exp(-\eta)$ where  typically $\eta\sim10$ and, as the gas cools down, the trap
depth is reduced to force further evaporation~\cite{OHara2001}.  

For a deeply degenerate Fermi gas,  $T \ll T_{F}$, the evaporation rate is
given by~\cite{OHara2001}.
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{\text{evap}} \propto \gamma_{\text{coll}} \frac{T}{T_{F}} 
  \exp\left[ -   
  \frac{ U_{\text{trap}} - \kb T_{F} }{ \kb T }  \right ] 
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_{\text{coll}}$ is the classical collision rate evaluated at the
Fermi surface.  This can also be written as 
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{\text{evap}} \propto \gamma_{\text{coll}} \frac{T}{T_{F}}
  \exp\left[ \frac{1}{T/T_{F}} \right]  
  \exp\left[ -  \frac{1}{T/T_{F}} \left( \frac{U_{\text{trap}}}{\kb T_{F}} \right) \right] 
\end{equation}
We define $ \eta_{F} \equiv U_{\text{trap}}/\kb T_{F}$ and observe that 
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{\text{evap}} \propto \gamma_{\text{coll}} \frac{T}{T_{F}}
  \exp\left[ -  \frac{\eta_{F} - 1 }{ T/T_{F} } \right]
\end{equation}
For the deeply degenerate gas, the $\eta$ factor which determines the
exponential suppression of the evaporation due to the trap depth is effectively
\begin{equation}
 \eta = \frac{\eta_{F} - 1 }{T/T_{F} } 
\end{equation}
Notice that the evaporation rate is additionally suppressed by a factor
$T/T_{F}$ due to Pauli blocking of one of the final states of a collision, which
occurs for $T\ll T_{F}$~\cite{OHara2001}.

We start by considering a red-detuned lattice with no extra confinement or
compensation.  We set  $n=1$ at the center of the sample and vary the waist of
the lattice beams.    From our knowledge of the potentials we can determine
$U_{\text{trap}}$, which in this case is the energy required for an atom to
escape along one of the lattice beams.   At a temperature of $T=1.8t$  we can
make the approximation $\kb T_{F} \approx \mu$, where $\mu$ is the global
chemical potential.  Figure~\ref{fig:etaF-no-comp_vary-wIR} shows $\eta_{F}$ as
a function of lattice beam waist, and also shows the number of atoms
required to achieve half-filling.

atoms is adjusted such that filling is $n=1$ at the center.   The required
number is shown on the right.}\label{fig:etaF-no-comp_vary-wIR}
\end{figure}

In our experiment we can produce cold samples with $\sim$350,000 atoms.   As
can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:etaF-no-comp_vary-wIR} (and also was already shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:HTSE_full-band-profiles_a}),  using a beam waist of
146\,$\mu$m would produce the confinement necessary to reach half-filling at
the center with $N=350,000$.  The flip side of this is that, for that beam
waist $\eta_{F}$ would be $\approx 8.5 $,  which for $T/T_{F}=0.1$ means that
the rate of evaporation would be suppressed by  
\begin{equation}
   \frac{T}{T_{F}}\exp\left[ - \frac{\eta_{F} - 1 }{T/T_{F} } 
 \right] \equiv \xi_{\text{evap}}\approx 10^{-34} 
\end{equation} 

Going back to our current setup, which has $w_{L}=47\,\mu$m and
$w_{C}=40\,\mu$m,  with 350,000 atoms; we can achieve half filling if we use
3.64$E_{R}$ of compensation.  This yields $\eta_{F} \approx 2.95$.  This is a
lot better than the large-beam-waist-uncompensated case, however the suppresion
factor for the rate of evaporative cooling is still very small.  For our
current setup it would be
\begin{equation}
 \xi_{\text{evap}} = 3.4\times 10^{-10} 
\end{equation}

Under typical evaporation conditions $\eta=10$, and for a non-degenerate sample
we have 
\begin{equation}
 \xi_{\text{evap}} = e^{-10} = 4.5\times 10^{-5} 
\end{equation}
We conclude that our current setup would  have an evaporation rate \textbf{five
orders of magnitude smaller} compared to the typical evaporative cooling rate
for a thermal gas (given the same rate of ellastic collisions
$\gamma_{\text{coll}}$).   In addition, in order to get a more realistic
estimate we would need to incorporate the implications of the chemical
potential being in a gapped region of the spectrum (for half-filling the chemical
potential is at the center of the Mott gap) which should further reduce the
evaporation rate.  

We now explore the entire parameter space, where we allow the lattice and
compensation beam waists to vary.   We set the chemical potential so that $n=1$
at the center of the sample,  we do this because half-filling is a prerequisite
to achieve Mott or N\'{e}el states.   We attempt to find a compensation such
that $N=350,000$ atoms.  For some values of the beam waists that is not
possible because it would lead to either spilling atoms from the
trap\footnote{In cases when $w_{C}>w_{L}$.} or to the creation of a negative
curvature in the confinement at the center of our sample\footnote{In cases when
$w_{C} < w_{L}$.  We also refer to this as making a donut}.

\caption{$\eta_{F}$ and $S/N$ and $N$ are plotted for various lattice and

compensation depth is ajusted so that  $N=350,000$ if it is possible, otherwise
it is set to maximize the atom number without spilling any atoms form the trap
or creating a mexican hat at the center of the potential.  The dotted line in
the plots corresponds to $w_{L}=w_{C}$.  The current values of our
experimental setup are shown as gray lines,  such that the intersection between
these two gray lines represents our current conditions. }

\end{figure}

The results of the
exploration of the beam waist paramater space are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:etaF-wIRwGR}.  The main points that stand out are
\begin{itemize}
\item  An optimal value of $\eta_{F}$ is achieved for $w_{L}\approx w_{C}$.  
\item  At $w_{L} \approx w_{C}$, smaller beam waists give better entropy capacity 
\item The atom number can only reach 350,000 if $w_{C} < w_{L}$, such as in our
current setup.  Otherwise the atom number is limited, being smaller for larger
$w_{C}$.
\end{itemize}


To get another look at the results, on Fig.~\ref{fig:etaF-wIRwGR-lines} we plot
$\eta_{F}$, $S/N$, and $N$  as a function of $w_{C}$ for three different values
of $w_{L}$.  The evaporation factor is optimized for nearly equal beam waists
and the entropy capacity also peaks up around there. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/etaF-wIRwGR-lines.png} \caption{
$\eta_{F}$, $S/N$, and $N$ as a function of $w_{C}$ for various values of $w_{L}$.  }
\label{fig:etaF-wIRwGR-lines}
\end{figure}
Given this observation,  we now set $w_{L}=w_{C}$ and vary both toghether  to see
if it is favorable to make smaller or larger beam waists.  This is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:etaF-wIR=wGR}.  The main observations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item  For beam waists up to $\approx68\,\mu$m one can keep getting lower
$\eta_{F}$ by making the beam waists larger.  This trend would continue if we
had an unlimited number of atoms, however beyond $\approx68\,\mu$m the number
of atoms required to fill the trap goes above our cap of 350,000 atoms.  
\item
For larger beam waists the entropy capacity is always lower, so the choice of
beam waist will be a compromise between $\eta_{F}$ and the entropy capacity. 
\end{itemize}

%In my opinion, the choice of beam waist should exploit the number of atoms that
%we have at our disposal


The results shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:etaF-wIR=wGR},~\ref{fig:etaF-wIRwGR-lines}
show that it is desireable to have equal lattice and compensation beam waists.
The choice of their value is a compromise between the achievable $\eta_{F}$ and
the entropy capacity, given by $S/N$.   Another important experimental
constraint is the available of power at the lattice and compensation
wavelengths, which is a bigger issue for larger beam waists.  In that case
larger power is necessary to achieve the required potential depths.   The
compensation power needed to compensate a 7\,$E_{R}$ lattice and the lattice
power needed to make a 40\,$E_{R}$ deep lattice\footnote{If we want to freeze
out tunnling in the lattice we required depths as large as 40\,$E_{R}$ where
the tunneling rate goes down to 3\,Hz.  We currently ``lock'' the lattice at
20\,$E_{R}$ for our Bragg scattering measurements.  At 20\,$E_{R}$ the
tunneling rate is 72\,Hz. This is good enough for Bragg scattering, but not
good enough for measurements that take longer, such as associating through the
narrow Feshbach resonance to measure double occupancies. } are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:green-power-wIR=wGR}.   With this in mind and our available
powers we can safely realize any choice of beam waists below $65\,\mu$m.

lattice powered required to achieve a 40\,$E_{R}$ lattice depth.  }
\label{fig:green-power-wIR=wGR}
\end{figure}

To fully exploit the atom number that we can produce in our experiment our
opinion is to go to the larger lattice beam waists,  so we recommend values of
$w_{L}=w_{C}=65\,\mu$m.   These proposed parameters  would change the
evaporation factor and entropy capacity and number capacity of our setup
according to the following table:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c|c|c|c|c|c}
   &  $w_{L}\,(\mu\mathrm{m})$ & $w_{C}\,(\mu\mathrm{m})$ 
   & $\eta_{F}$  & $\xi_{\text{evap}}$ &  $S/N$  \\ \hline 
 Current setup &  47 & 40  &  2.95 & $3.4\times 10^{-10}$  &   1.94  \\ 
 Proposed change & 65 & 65  &  1.52 & $1.36\times 10^{-5}$  &   1.99  \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We see that for the optimal beam waist ratio a value of
$\xi_{\text{evap}}\sim10^{-5}$ may be reached that could lead to reasonable
rates of evaporation in the lattice.  A comparison of our current setup and
this proposed scenario is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:etaF-before-after}.
